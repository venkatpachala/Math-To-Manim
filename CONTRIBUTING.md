### Contributing Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Make your changes
4. Write or update tests as necessary
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Submit a pull request

### Contributing Examples

One of the most valuable contributions you can make is to add new examples of mathematical animations. To contribute an example:

1. Create a new Python file in the appropriate directory (or create a new directory if needed)
2. Include detailed comments explaining the mathematical concepts
3. Ensure the code runs successfully with Manim
4. Add documentation for the example in `docs/EXAMPLES.md`
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarleyCoops/Math-To-Manim.git
   cd Math-To-Manim
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install FFmpeg (required for Manim):
   - Windows: Download from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ and add to PATH
   - Linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
   - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`

5. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your preferred API key
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env    # For Claude
   echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env       # For Gemini
   echo "MOONSHOT_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env     # For Kimi
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the style guidelines
2. Update documentation as necessary
3. Include tests for new features
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit the pull request with a clear description of the changes
